    <p>A reading guide is a tool that helps students understand a text by responding to prompts or questions about it. Reading guides can be used by teachers to help students navigate complex texts, and are especially useful for students who are reading below grade level. <br>
        Here are some tips for using reading guides: <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Use a variety of strategies </li>
        <li>Reading guides can be used to target any reading strategy, and can be a good way to introduce new strategies.</li>
        <li>Work with a partner</li>
        <li>Reading guides can be a powerful tool for partners to use together to deepen their understanding of a text.</li>
        <li>Move towards independence</li>
        <li>As students become more proficient, they can move towards using strategies without a guide, or even creating their own guides. </li>
        </ul>
        Some other tips for improving reading skills include: 
        <ul>
        <li>Setting aside time to read each day </li>
        <li>Previewing texts before reading </li>
        <li>Taking notes while reading </li>
        <li>Summarizing what you've read </li>
        <li>Reading in a comfortable, distraction-free environment </li>
        <li>Taking regular breaks while reading</li>
         </ul></p>
